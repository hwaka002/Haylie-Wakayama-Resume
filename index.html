        <p class="lead mb-4">As a current first-year biology major at the University of California, Riverside, I am seeking opportunities to explore and expand my knowledge by gaining hands-on experience in real world situations. I made the decision to focus on biology strongly through my interest in the courses I have taken as a kid. My interest and passion started at quite a young age. For as long as I remember, I have always been fascinated by the ways that the world worked and how every living thing was like a system with their own specific functions and unique differences. I also was intrigued by the potential and possibilities that the biological field had towards helping others and advancing our understanding of science as a whole, especially in the sense of doing things for the greater good. <br><br>

        Since I am still young, I have not been able to gain work experience in my desired field, but have been involved in various extracurricular activities or coursework that gifted me with the relevant skills necessary in such situations. Last quarter, I was able to be a part of two introductory laboratory courses, which allowed me to learn the basics of micropipetting, DNA sequences, and many other strategies. Through this, I also had to begin writing lab reports, ensuring that I understood each individual concept every week. This quarter, I am enrolled in the next level of these two laboratory courses, where I am continuing to expand my understanding of how to properly experiment in a professional setting. <br><br>

        In addition to this, I was taught the value of teamwork and leadership early on. Although it did not necessarily apply to biology, I was employed at a property management office throughout the summers of high school. I gained organizational skills from keeping track of the countless files and I also gained communication skills by working at the front desk, answering all the phone calls and emails for the company. Another experience that I truly learned a lot from was tutoring refugee students in Texas over quarantine. Giving back to the community has always been important to me as well. I also enjoyed being able to learn how to effectively explain concepts to younger students, teaching me more about different learning techniques.
